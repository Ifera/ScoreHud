# If you want same scoreboard to be displayed in every
# world then set 'multi-world.active' to false in config.yml.
#
# If you have 'multi-world.active' set to true and want to
# display a default scoreboard for a world you didn't mention
# in 'scoreboards' key below then set 'multi-world.active' along
# with 'multi-world.use-default' keys to true in config.yml.
