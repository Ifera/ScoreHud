## Version 6.0.0

#### The main goal of version 6.0 update was to remove ScoreHud dependency pocketmine tasks. So that was achieved by making ScoreHud **event driven**! <br />

**Q: But what exactly does event driven mean? And what are its benefits?** <br />
A: Well, its simple, instead of using **tasks** to update values on scoreboard every 20 or so ticks even when there was **no
update**, ScoreHud now **listens for events** that are fired by the plugin which implements ScoreHud. In doing so, the scoreboard
is **only updated when there is an actual update** and not the other way round. Although not tested but this should **improve
ScoreHud's performance**.<br />

**Addon support was removed** with version 6.0 update. Reason being that it was no longer feasible and users had reported addons
not working on different systems either due to hosting problem or some other reasons. Removing addons and listening to events
instead should now **work on almost all systems**.<br />

ScoreHud using events is in the **benefit of plugin developers and the end-user** as well. Users no longer will need to download
and place addons in separate folder. And plugin developers will no longer need to make a separate addon for ScoreHud. They
can just integrate ScoreHud directly into their plugin and fire events to update their tags on ScoreHud.
