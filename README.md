### FAQs:

**Q: Help I am getting this error. `Required extension Core has an incompatible version (7.x.y not >=7.4)`**<br />
A: This means that the PHP binary that your server is using is outdated. Please update it to v7.4 or greater to continue using ScoreHud. <br /><br />
**Q: How many lines can I set in `default-board`?**<br />
A: You can set 1 to 15 lines in `default-board`. <br /><br />
**Q: How many `server-names` can I set?**<br />
A: You can set infinite many number of `server-names`. <br /><br />
**Q: I am having problems and cannot set the plugin correctly. What do I do?**<br />
A: Well you can always open a new issue on this repository or contact me via Discord: `Ifera#3717` or Twitter: `@ifera_tr`. <br /><br />
**Q: I like the plugin. What do I do?**<br />
A: Well, that is extremely fortunate. Why not to star this repository and might as well a good review on [poggit](https://poggit.pmmp.io/p/ScoreHud).<br /><br />
**Q: What happened to addons?**<br />
A: Addons system being simple and similar to pocketmine had some flaws especially when combined with tasks caused a great deal of lag. ScoreHud is now event driven and no longer depends on tasks, so it was only fitting to remove addon support as a whole. <br />
