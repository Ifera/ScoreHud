## Version 7.0.0

- PocketMine-MP API 4 support.
- ScoreFactory v3.1.0.
- PHP 8 support.
- Integrated BasicScore plugin within ScoreHud.
- Major performance improvement as compared to previous versions - thanks in part to ScoreFactory.
- ScoreHud can now update a single line on the scoreboard instead of resending the entire board.
- No more scoreboard flickering.
- Scoreboard is only added once and then only those lines are updated which are changed as compared the previous versions where when there was a single line change the entire board had to be removed and everything had to recalculated and re-sent to the player.
- An option in config to switch between single line update or full board update.
