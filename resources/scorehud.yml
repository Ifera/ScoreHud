# =============================
# SCOREHUD VERSION 6.0+ NOTE:
# =============================
#
# Plugin developers are responsible for adding support for ScoreHud
# in their plugins. Starting from ScoreHud version 6.0 onwards addon
# support has been removed.
#
# ScoreHud is now event driven and all previous addons will no longer
# work unless the author of that plugin adds support for ScoreHud in
# their own plugin.
#
# If you want support for a plugin please ask the plugin author of
# that plugin to add support for ScoreHud in their plugin.
# =============================

# Set the title for the scoreboard shown.
titles:
  # If *true* then 'titles.lines' will be used for showing changing
  # or flickering titles. Although fancy but they might cause lag
  # so be your own judge. This may also cause the scoreboard to
  # flicker at times. (not preferred)
  #
  # If *false* then 'titles.title' will be used for showing a simple
  # title on the scoreboard. (preferred)
  flicker: false

  # If 'titles.flicker' is set to true then adjust the rate at which
  # the titles should change. In seconds.
  # Default: 5 (seconds)
  period: 5

  # A simple title that will be displayed for scoreboard.
  title: "§l§aServer §dName"

  # Changing titles. Add as many as you desire.
  lines:
  - "§l§aServer §dName"
  - "§l§bServer §cName"
  - "§l§cServer §bName"
  - "§l§dServer §aName"

# ==================
# IMPORTANT NOTE:
# ==================
# You can only set a maximum of 15 lines and no more. #blameMOJANG
#
# Also note that you need 'ScoreHudX' plugin for some tags to work.

# ==================

# You can edit the lines already set below and adjust them
# according to your needs.
#
# If you want same scoreboard to be displayed in every
# world then set 'multi-world.active' to false in config.yml.
#
# If you have 'multi-world.active' set to true and want to
# display a default scoreboard for a world you didn't mention
# in 'scoreboards' key below then set 'multi-world.active' along
# with 'multi-world.use-default' keys to true in config.yml.
default-board:
- ""
- "§dName: §5{scorehud.name}"
- ""
- "§bOnline: §a{scorehud.online} §c/ §d{scorehud.max_online}"
- ""
- "§6Please Vote for us!"

# If you want to display different scoreboards for every world
# then set 'multi-world.active' to true in config.yml.
#
# After that edit the following to suit your needs.
scoreboards:
# EXAMPLE CONFIGURATION:
# ------------------
