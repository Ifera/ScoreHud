# You can edit the lines already set below and adjust them
# according to your needs.
#
# If you want same scoreboard to be displayed in every
# world then set 'multi-world.active' to false in config.yml.
#
# If you have 'multi-world.active' set to true and want to
# display a default scoreboard for a world you didn't mention
# in 'scoreboards' key below then set 'multi-world.active' along
# with 'multi-world.use-default' keys to true in config.yml.

- ""
- "§dName: §5{scorehud.name}"
- ""
- "§bOnline: §a{scorehud.online} §c/ §d{scorehud.max_online}"

# If you want to display different scoreboards for every world
# then set 'multi-world.active' to true in config.yml.
#
# After that edit the following to suit your needs.
